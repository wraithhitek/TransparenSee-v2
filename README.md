# AI-Powered MPLAD Anomaly, Fraud & Inefficiency Detection System
### Team Outlier Ops— Smart India Hackathon 2026

> **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) Problem Statement:**  
> **Development of an AI-powered system to detect anomalies, fraud, and inefficiencies in MPLAD Scheme implementation**

## 📌 Overview

The **Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS)** supports the creation of durable community assets and local development infrastructure through projects recommended by Members of Parliament.

With a large number of projects, contractors, financial transactions, locations, timelines, and implementation records, manually identifying irregularities can be difficult and time-consuming.

Our solution is an **AI-powered web-based monitoring and decision-support platform** that analyzes MPLAD project data to identify:

- Financial anomalies
- Suspicious or abnormal project costs
- Duplicate or potentially overlapping projects
- Project delays and inefficiencies
- Contractor performance risks
- Unusual payment patterns
- Mismatch between reported and observed project progress
- Other patterns that require further investigation

The system does **not automatically declare an individual or organization fraudulent**. Instead, it generates a **risk score, supporting evidence, and investigation priority** so that authorized officials can make informed decisions.

---

## 🎯 Problem We Are Solving

MPLAD implementation can involve a large amount of heterogeneous data, including:

- Project details
- Sanctioned and estimated costs
- Expenditure and payment records
- Contractor information
- Project timelines
- Geographical coordinates
- Project categories
- Progress reports
- Photographs and supporting documents
- Historical project performance

Analyzing all these factors manually makes it difficult to identify subtle patterns such as:

> A project costing significantly more than similar projects in the same region.

> A contractor repeatedly associated with delayed or over-budget projects.

> Multiple projects appearing to represent the same or nearby work.

> Reported project progress being inconsistent with available evidence.

Our platform aims to convert this raw information into **actionable intelligence**.

---

# 🚀 Proposed Solution

Our system combines **data analytics, machine learning, anomaly detection, geospatial analysis, and visual verification** into a single platform.

# 🔍 Key Features

## 1. Financial Anomaly Detection

The system analyzes project costs and expenditure patterns to identify unusual financial behavior.

### Examples

- Cost significantly higher than similar projects
- Unexpected expenditure increases
- Excessive cost overruns
- Unusual payment patterns
- Potential duplicate payments

### Example

```text
Project Cost       : ₹40 Lakh
Expected Cost      : ₹25 Lakh
Deviation          : 60%

⚠️ HIGH COST ANOMALY
```

The expected cost can be estimated using historical projects with similar characteristics such as project type, location, scale, and other available parameters.

---

## 2. Project Delay & Inefficiency Detection

The platform compares planned project timelines with actual progress.

It can identify:

- Delayed projects
- Projects with slow progress
- Projects likely to miss their completion deadline
- Repeated delays associated with particular contractors
- Projects with unusually long implementation periods

### Example

```text
Expected Progress : 80%
Reported Progress : 42%

⚠️ POSSIBLE DELAY
```

The system can also calculate a **delay-risk score**.

---

## 3. Contractor Risk Analysis

Historical contractor performance can be analyzed to identify recurring patterns.

Possible indicators include:

- Number of completed projects
- Number of delayed projects
- Frequency of cost overruns
- Average project completion time
- Number of anomalies associated with previous projects
- Repeated involvement in high-risk projects

### Example

```text
Contractor: ABC Construction

Projects Completed : 24
Delayed Projects   : 9
Cost Overruns      : 6
High-Risk Projects : 5

Contractor Risk Score: 78/100
Status: HIGH RISK
```

A high risk score means the contractor's projects deserve closer review; it does not itself establish wrongdoing.

---

## 4. Duplicate & Similar Project Detection

The system can identify projects that appear unusually similar based on:

- Location
- Project description
- Project category
- Project dates
- Cost
- Contractor
- Geographic proximity

For example, if two records describe nearly identical infrastructure at almost the same location, the system can flag them for verification.

```text
Project A
Community Hall
Location: X
Cost: ₹15 Lakh

        ↕ Similarity Detection

Project B
Community Hall
Location: X + 100m
Cost: ₹14 Lakh

⚠️ POSSIBLE DUPLICATE / OVERLAPPING PROJECT
```

Natural Language Processing can be used to compare project descriptions.

---

## 5. Geospatial Analysis

Every project with geographical information can be visualized on an interactive map.

The map can show:

- Project locations
- Project categories
- Project status
- High-risk projects
- Project clusters
- Nearby similar projects
- Geographic anomalies

### Example

```text
🟢 Low Risk
🟡 Medium Risk
🔴 High Risk
⚠️ Requires Investigation
```

This enables officials to identify geographic patterns and prioritize field verification.

---

## 6. Project Progress Verification

Where photographs, geotagged images, or other visual evidence are available, the platform can compare reported progress with available evidence.

Potential computer vision capabilities include:

- Before/after image comparison
- Construction progress assessment
- Image similarity detection
- Detection of inconsistent or repeated images
- Verification of whether visible infrastructure corresponds to the reported project

This module is designed as an **additional evidence layer**, not as the sole basis for declaring a project fraudulent.

---

# 🧠 AI & Machine Learning

Our architecture can combine multiple AI/ML techniques instead of depending on a single model.

### Anomaly Detection

Potential techniques:

- Isolation Forest
- Local Outlier Factor
- One-Class SVM
- Autoencoders

Useful for identifying unusual project and financial behavior without requiring every anomaly to be manually labeled.

### Predictive Models

Potential models:

- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Logistic Regression

Useful for:

- Delay-risk prediction
- Project-risk classification
- Contractor-risk scoring
- Cost estimation

### NLP

Potential techniques:

- TF-IDF + cosine similarity
- Sentence Transformers
- Transformer-based embeddings

Useful for comparing project descriptions and detecting potentially duplicate or overlapping projects.

### Computer Vision

Potential technologies:

- OpenCV
- YOLO
- CNN-based image models

Useful for analyzing project photographs and visual progress evidence.

# 📊 Unified Risk Score

One of the main outputs of our system is a **Project Risk Score**.

Example:

```text
              PROJECT #MPLAD1023

              RISK SCORE: 87/100
                   🔴 HIGH

     ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
     │ Cost Anomaly       : 92           │
     │ Delay Risk         : 78           │
     │ Contractor Risk    : 85           │
     │ Duplicate Risk     : 61           │
     │ Progress Anomaly   : 90           │
     └──────────────────────────────────┘

     Recommendation:
     PRIORITIZE FOR HUMAN INVESTIGATION
```

The score combines multiple independent signals.

This allows officials to focus their attention on projects with the highest combination of risk indicators.

---

# 🤖 Explainable AI

A key principle of our solution is **explainability**.

Instead of simply displaying:

> `Risk = 89`

the system explains:

> **Why is this project high risk?**

For example:

```text
🔴 High Risk

Reasons:
✓ Project cost is significantly higher than comparable projects
✓ Project is behind its planned timeline
✓ Contractor has a history of delayed projects
✓ Similar project detected nearby
✓ Reported progress differs from available visual evidence
```

This makes the platform more useful for real-world decision-making.

# 🔐 Important Design Principle

**AI will assist investigation, not replace human judgment.**

A detected anomaly does **not** automatically mean fraud.

The platform will distinguish between:

```text
Anomaly
   ↓
Risk Indicator
   ↓
Evidence Collection
   ↓
Human Verification
   ↓
Official Decision
```

This helps reduce false accusations and makes the system suitable as a **decision-support and monitoring platform**.
